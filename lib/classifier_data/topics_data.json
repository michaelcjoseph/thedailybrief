The founder of Leonard Manasseh and Partners, he was the architect of the former Rutherford school in Marylebone, west London, and the Rotork factory in Bath, as well as of a number of distinctive private houses.Manasseh, who has died aged 100, designed Rutherford school to a conventional plan in 1957, but its bold sculptural forms – in particular its tall pyramid over the assembly hall, balanced by the inverted pyramid of the water tanks – attracted wide professional attention. The building, off Lisson Grove, was (and still is) full of remarkable details: marble walls, a sculpture court, a stained-glass window. The critic Diana Rowntree praised it in the Guardian in July 1960 and it pleased the London county council, too, because it was completed early and under budget. Continue reading..."},

The time I spent with him and his beautiful German-born partner, Sigrid Nama, in Derek’s native St. Lucia changed my life in ways that extended past the New Yorker Profile I wrote in 2004. I felt as though I had always known him—not known him, exactly, but seen him, been in his aura, his history, because, like my father, Derek was the product of a profound world, a distinctly Caribbean world with its history of colonialism and its imperceptible change, and home to so much more, including mothers who spared no amount of love to make you understand that you were their bright boy. Derek’s mother, Alix Maarlin, a schoolteacher, helped him publish his first poems, and it was the light of that first love that Derek always stood under; it made him shy about intimacy, while closeness was something he always sought. The first Mrs. Walcott believed in him with a pride that eclipsed the great honor of his 1992 Nobel Prize for Literature because she was the first to say, if only in her mind: Why not be Shakespeare?

While others were writing confessional poetry, she ensured that she wrote at a distance. Poems which in original drafts mentioned characteristics of a lover were revised, sometimes as many as 17 times, in order to make the final work as polished and as impersonal as possible. She was a lesbian who never publicly admitted to the term, even as younger gay poets in the 1970s embraced it (partners were friends or even a secretary). She was an alcoholic who was ashamed of her drinking, but never sought long-term treatment.

I had read him, and loved him, in college—Hard Times and Bleak House and Our Mutual Friend were the most admired texts in the nineteen-sixties; and then, on my own, soon after college, I read David Copperfield and Martin Chuzzlewit, with its hilarious impressions of the newspaper-and-spittoon dominated America of the eighteen-forties. I knew a couple of the other novels because they had been read to me, after lunch, in seventh grade, at my New York private school. You could put your head down on the desk and go to sleep—no one would bother you. The rest of us listened. Our homeroom teacher, a woman with freckled skin and white hair named Ruth K. Landis, read first Oliver Twist and then Great Expectations in a steady dulcet voice. At the emotional climaxes, Miss Landis grew rather tearful, but no one mocked her. It was an enchanting way to launch the rest of the school day. I mention all this because my acquaintance with Dickens was more or less typical of what literary-minded, privileged boys and girls of a certain era enjoyed."},

In 2008, Burn published Born Yesterday: The News as Novel, which he had written to a punishingly tight schedule during the course of 2007.

It read more like an act of survival than a novel, but whether it was the author’s survival or mine, I wasn’t sure. I had stopped drinking alcohol and I was looking, simply, for another drug. The book made me high; it offered multiple universes, all of them safer than vodka.The Dice Man is seemingly an autobiography, narrated by a bored, clever New York psychiatrist, Luke Rhinehart. He is a nerd run mad. He decides that, in pursuit of ultimate freedom – or nihilism – he will make decisions using dice. He offers the dice options, and they choose for him. The dice tell him to rape his neighbour, but he fails because she wants him. The dice make him tell his patients what he thinks of them (my favourite dice decision).

In my case the work was for the drugs and the drugs were for the work, and then when there was no work at all I had the nervous breakdown. The observation, despite its glibness, concisely sets up the central dynamics of Phillips’s tale, which appears to be about drugs but is more significantly about work and the difficulty of escaping the ouroboros of production and consumption. In 1973, at only thirty, Phillips—who died in 2002, of cancer—became the first woman to win a Best Picture Oscar, for producing The Sting along with her husband at the time, Michael Phillips, and their business partner, Tony Bill; she later produced classics like Taxi Driver and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Her cocaine-fuelled rise up the ranks of the newly risk-taking Hollywood of the nineteen-seventies was as swift as it was heady. I get on a plane at night, meet a new P.R. guy, read my list of interviews for the next day, have dinner, take a valium, sleep, wake up, have some blow, knock ’em dead and get on a plane, she writes of promoting a movie as a young producer.

Utopia was not the first scholarly attempt to imagine a perfect society—More frequently acknowledged Plato’s Republic—but it has become the name that we use to describe such visions (with dystopia, its opposite, appearing in the 1950s).

At 16, he was told the truth, and 40 years on he’s written an illuminating memoirIn 1977, when he was 16, Sam Miller’s mother, Jane, turned to him and said: There’s something I want to tell you. What followed was brief and to the point. Sam’s real father was not, she announced, her husband, the writer and legendary editor Karl Miller, but his close friend, Tony White, who had died, at the age of just 45, only the year before. Karl, she said, had known the truth about this right from the start, and had always loved Sam as his own. Mother and son then returned to the job in hand, which was the painting of his bedroom a somewhat forbidding shade of dark blue.Family secrets are supposed to be corrosive. In a novel, such a revelation might have turned our hero overnight into a troubled teenager. But though he writes in his new memoir, Fathers, that his mother’s words set off a slow-motion cascade of feelings and reactions and consequences, most readers will be struck by the calmness with which Miller received them, and by how little real effect they had on his world. In their house in Chelsea, where Jane still lives today (and where I meet her son on a crisp February morning), life went on as usual. Karl was teaching at University College London, where he’d recently been appointed a professor of English literature; Jane, a future academic and writer, was busy training teachers; Sam and his siblings – Miller has an older brother and a younger sister – continued to shuttle between home and school. In 1979, Sam went to visit White’s cottage in Connemara and his (then) unmarked grave. But otherwise there were no immediate consequences. It was another 35 years before he and Karl would refer to the matter. Continue reading..."},

The hunch, he explains, is a result of the garden shed he bought four years ago as a place in which to write. His daughter had turned one and he was just starting his latest novel, A Natural, locked up in there from nine till six with an electric heater to warm his legs and a jar of boiled sweets to keep him going. It’s not much bigger than this table, is the shed, he says, appraising the pine surface strewn with tea things. We are sitting in a cafe in Stoke Newington, north London, not far from the flat he shares with his wife, Anne, and their two young children.The new book marks a departure from Raisin’s previous work, the award-winning God’s Own Country, and Waterline, which together earned him a place on Granta’s 2013 list of 20 best young novelists. Both books were celebrated for the brilliantly distinctive voices of their outsider protagonists – respectively the loner son of a Yorkshire farmer and a former shipbuilder exiled from his life by grief. God’s Own Country (2008) fused Yorkshire dialect with made-up words so the text pops and spurts with its main character’s distinctive idiom. Waterline (2011) was heavy on the Glaswegian vernacular, and was hailed by Alan Warner as a triumph of ventriloquism and empathy. Continue reading..."},

After I learned that the writer Paula Fox had died last week, at the age of ninety-three, I took out my copy of Desperate Characters, her best-known novel, wary of the temptation to indulge in solipsistic interpretation. Desperate Characters is partly about gentrification in New York, an inescapable fact of life in the city as we live it now. But it was published in 1970, and so the late-sixties New York it describes—seedy and decrepit, its abandoned streets blowsy with garbage and drunks—is many moons from our own hale town bursting with chain-store, starchitect vigor. There was no need to worry. The novel—tense, quick, prickling with suppressed panic—is very much of its time and has a lot to say to ours, too.

The film, which shot to No. 1 at the box office, brazenly inhabits the anxieties that surround miscegenation in our still racially stratified country. The movie’s sharp scares, gallows humor, and insidious intelligence are informed by the sensibility, and insistent paranoia, that lurks within the hearts of blacks who must navigate white spaces. The film is a major achievement, a work that deserves, in its own way, to be viewed alongside Barry Jenkins’s Moonlight as a giant leap forward for the possibilities of black cinema; Get Out feels like it would have been impossible five minutes ago."},

We chart their rise and talk to directors Ana Lily Amirpour, Julia Ducournau and Karyn KusamaThere’s a moment in French film-maker Julia Ducournau’s prize-winning feature debut Raw in which a young vegetarian (ethereally played by Garance Marillier) finds herself unexpectedly ravenous at the sight of a severed finger. It’s a deliciously horrifying vignette, squirm-inducingly squishy, yet somehow bizarrely sensual. Like Claire Denis’s controversial 2001 shocker Trouble Every Day, Raw takes an intimate approach to the taboo subject of cannibalism, sinking its teeth into the sins of the flesh. As all great horror films should, it touches a nerve – simultaneously repelling and seducing its audience, sucking us in and spitting us out.For horror fans, Raw is the latest in an encouraging wave of genre-bending movies which have twisted familiar tropes to new and unsettling ends. At the end of 2015, my yearly Observer list of the 10 best films released in UK cinemas featured both Carol Morley’s eerie The Falling and A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night, an electrifying Iranian-American vampire western which writer/director Ana Lily Amirpour described as being the love-child of Sergio Leone and David Lynch, with Nosferatu as a babysitter. In 2014, Jennifer Kent’s The Babadook had been my pick of the year – a spine-chilling fantasia which drew on folk tales and silent film techniques as it subtly unpicked the grief and paranoia of a single mother, habitually projecting her fears onto her lonely child.

Invited to cover it for Australian readers, I was struck by an unusual commonality: almost every film I watched revolved around a woman, or women, at work. The French actor Nathalie Baye has spoken before about the opportunities presented to older women in the industry. She told me: We are fortunate in France. Cinema here is more inspired by real life, and for women, real life doesn’t stop at the age of 45. In fact, there’s more going on – and more interesting things happening to them.

Most movie music is dull to listen to on its own, no matter how well it enhances the film in which it’s deployed. With relatively few exceptions, the best effects that scores can have are subliminal, fused with and inseparable from the over-all experience of the movie. That’s because, for the most part, music is used in movies as sonic wallpaper, covering silences and images with an indifferent and casually factitious unity. That’s also why, for the most part, what makes movie music distinctive isn’t so much the composition itself as the way that it’s used. Creative soundtracks take musical pieces that might otherwise be only adequate, or at least not significantly better than other scores, and elevate them to the realm of the filmmaker’s own artistry. On the other hand, the use of great music in movies poses an exceptional challenge for filmmakers, who must make a movie that’s worthy of its soundtrack, and use the scores in a way that rivals the music itself in creative originality."},

This might sound like typically glamorous pop star behaviour, but when it comes to hedonism, I was expecting more. After all, if the songs released so far by the Swedish musician – Smoke Weed Eat Pussy, Spun and Housewife Spliffin’ – are to be taken literally, her daily routine revolves around excessive weed consumption and oral sex. These are both relatively standard themes when you consider rock and rap’s more rebellious corners, but coming from a 21-year-old woman with candy-coloured hair, it’s proved too traumatic for some to grasp. The Sun labelled her the most shocking pop star of 2016, while the Mirror last year claimed she was the most controversial star it had ever seen.The tabloids won’t be the only ones appalled. Her heavily Auto-Tuned vocals, repeating the same deliberately vacant phrases, will almost certainly infuriate fans of real music. Her sound is a distillation of modern influences. She possesses the poised, pastel aesthetics of Lana Del Rey; the solemnity and sugar-coated sweetness of Kali Uchis; PC Music’s robotic pop sensibilities; and hints at the post-emo sad lad rap sentiment spearheaded by fellow Swede Yung Lean, or US misery rappers such as Lil Peep and Yung Goth. She’s cartoonishly playful, with a disconcerting darkness rippling underneath. Or, as she describes herself down the phone from Sweden: It’s nice to have cute things with hard punches.

None of her projects, though, have taken her into such alien territory as MK Ultra.Named after the experiments in mind control that the CIA developed during the last century, Kay’s new show explores the phenomenon of the Illuminati, a shadowy cult believed to be on an elaborate mission of global domination, spreading its agenda through the brainwashing of prominent individuals in politics and the media.

But in this year’s festival you could see Kyle Abraham’s Pavement looking very much as it did when it premièred, at Harlem Stage Gatehouse, four years ago. Nowadays, you don’t retire a dance that is both concerned with race and very good. In any case, this 2012 piece shows us, with no need of updating, that the circumstances underlying the Black Lives Matter movement preceded its actual founding, in 2013, in response to the acquittal of Trayvon Martin’s killer. Indeed, as Abraham has said, the dance was inspired by John Singleton’s movie Boyz n the Hood, now twenty-five years old. Singleton’s boys, all African-American, lived in South Central Los Angeles. Abraham’s are in Pittsburgh, his home town, and, interestingly, two of the six dancers are white. (One is a woman.) But the subject is the same: fear, and vigilance. If you’re a young person in one of this city’s black neighborhoods, you don’t have to do or be anything special in order to get killed. The score of Pavement, a montage of J. C. Bach, Jacques Brel, Sam Cooke, and many others, is punctuated by snippets of dialogue from Boyz n the Hood. Here’s one: My mama say, ‘A bullet don’t have no name on it.’ "},

It wasn’t the first time that the American public was privy to this odd sartorial habit (on Inauguration Day, he employed the same trick), but this latest appearance garnered especially spirited mockery online: Was this perhaps a metaphor for the early public struggles of his Administration, a Presidency so far held together with, if not spit and glue, then spit and scotch tape? The photos, providing only an accidental glimpse at the underside of Trump’s tie, also provide a serviceable metaphor for the new President’s relationship to being photographed. Trump is the most radically accessible President in American history: we have, via Twitter, a direct connection to what seems to be the animal portions of his brain. Yet, in the first months of his Presidency, the Trump we’ve seen in images is almost exclusively the official, public-facing Trump, and his Administration’s use of photography has been much more limited than that of his immediate predecessor."},

And our hero Uthred is gearing up for it with odd leper plans – while priests are starting riots and Danes are being slaughteredThis blog is for those who have watched the first episode of series two of The Last Kingdom. Please try and avoid book spoilers in the comments. Hello everyone and welcome back to Wessex. We picked up a few months after the battle of Ethandun, which cost Uhtred so dear, and it was clear our hero had not taken his personal losses well, choosing to retreat into wine, women and, yes, song. (I was tickled to learn from his throwaway line about commissioning his own ode to his battle glory I was drunk and the song was tuneless.) Meanwhile Alfred, increasingly confident in his own power, has his eye on a spot of nation-building – and knows just which hot-headed Saxon raised as a Dane might be manipulated into helping him achieve it. All this made for a strong opening episode, which set the scene for conflict to come and introduced us to both a host of intriguing new characters and the return of some very nasty enemies from Uhtred’s past.

But the latest age of peak TV has coincided with the rise of a very different kind of storytelling. One played out on news channels rather than Netflix. The practitioners are ideological fabulists – your Trumps, your Milos, your Nuttalls – and while they might lack basic craft, intellectual rigour and moral discipline, when it comes to telling their tall tales they are worryingly prolific in their attempts to own the narrative. When real life is wilder than Westworld, how can TV compete?Joe Ahearne, the writer and director behind BBC1’s recent workplace thriller The Replacement, has witnessed the rise of alt-truth in public life with relatable exasperation. The Replacement’s ultra-capable antagonist Paula (Vicky McClure) may have created her own reality, Trump-style, to cope with buried trauma but Ahearne insists there is an integrity to the character that Potus and his fellow freewheeling fibbers lack.

Diners run for cover, waiters hurry tables, chairs, crockery indoors, and Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon stand in the doorway, continuing their lunchtime conversation about the death of Sir Thomas More and how they would each choose to execute the other. I like it when people think this is real, says Brydon, as the rain hammers down. I would never have such a toxic conversation with a friend.Since it began in 2010, The Trip has made unexpectedly devotional viewing. It is a curious premise: Brydon and Coogan play exaggerated versions of themselves – two sometime friends, comedians in middle age, dispatched to review restaurants together. First they headed to the north of England, dining at L’Enclume and the Inn at Whitewell and riffing over Wordsworth and Coleridge, Michael Caine and sticky toffee pudding. Next came an adventure through Italy, from Liguria to Capri, filled with seafood linguine and artichokes, Byron and Shelley and Alanis Morissette.

The Skin of Our Teeth is currently onstage at the Polansky Shakespeare Theatre, in Brooklyn, directed by Arin Arbus. It’s a lollapalooza.

What drives each of the three works is memory, and how it can twist or reveal the truth, making unreliable narrators of us all. Victor Franz (Mark Ruffalo) is a fortyish N.Y.C. police sergeant whose body and handsome face sag a little with regret. He has returned to a brownstone in Manhattan—it sags, too—that’s about to be demolished; it was his childhood home. He lived there with his brother Walter (Tony Shalhoub) and their now dead parents. Victor slowly enters an old room filled with the relics of the past—a Victrola, chairs, a breakfront, and so on—and, of course, he is bemused and rueful and sad as he walks down memory lane, sometimes touching a piece of old furniture, or listening to a scratchy old record, because this is a realistic play by Arthur Miller, the author of All My Sons (1947) and Death of a Salesman (1949), elegies about hope made corrupt by the exigencies of living, and about how the past pulls at the present."},

Their impact was intensified by his habit of incorporating the frame, actual or suggested, as part of the picture.Like Francis Bacon, though, it pleased Hodgkin to refer to himself as a figurative painter; and, as with Bacon’s suggestion that his own smeared agonies were realist, Hodgkin’s use of the term figurative seemed to most viewers of these sumptuously coloured abstractions nothing more than a tease. If so, it was a tease that they enjoyed, because his prime Hodgkin became one of the most popular artists in Britain, with many successful shows abroad as well, particularly in the US, Germany, and Italy, where in 1984 he represented his country in an acclaimed show at the Venice Biennale.

If you like your shock undampened, turn back now.

The 32-year-old fashion designer from Magherafelt, Northern Ireland, puts out 12 collections a year as both head of his own label, JW Anderson, and creative director of the Spanish luxury brand, Loewe. He is constantly jumping on and off the Eurostar, splitting his week between London and Paris, where each label is respectively based. So when the Hepworth Wakefield gallery in Yorkshire asked him to curate an exhibition, he probably, for the sake of his schedule, should have politely declined. But as someone who collects himself, and who is passionate about modern British art (specifically, Barbara Hepworth) the collaboration seemed like a natural fit. The gallery’s location was also a major draw. I’m glad to be putting creative energy into something that is about getting people out of London, Anderson explains. We are not trapped – go out and there are amazing things to be seen, and off he goes in his dizzying way, jumping from one thought to the next. He enthuses about how this politically turbulent moment is the best time to be creative; he tells me that photographer Jamie Hawkesworth, a long-time collaborator, has taken pictures of 123 Yorkshire schoolchildren wearing garments from the show, for an accompanying book, before finally pausing for breath and concluding: It is quite petrifying doing something like this, because it opens you up to both the art and the fashion worlds, who are equally critical. But I’ve come to the point where it’s not about that. It’s more about the idea of all of this, in Wakefield. Continue reading..."},

When better times return, some theories fade from memory. Others linger, however. During the economic mess of the past decade, economists frightened themselves with tales of secular stagnation: a nasty condition that dooms its victims to chronically weak growth. Now that the economic outlook is brightening a bit—deflation has been dispatched, and for most advanced economies 2017 is forecast to bring a third consecutive year of economic growth—it is tempting to laugh off the idea of secular stagnation as a bit of crisis-induced hysteria. Tempting, but also premature.In a time of secular stagnation, the normal relationship between saving and investment goes haywire. People save some portion of their income each year. Because one person’s spending is another’s income, such saving can drain away demand and lead to recession, unless the funds set aside by savers are reinjected into the economy through lending to those looking to invest: as when banks lend savers’ deposits to businesses, for example.

It is one of the more irritating things that a boss can tell you. But at the macroeconomic level, it is important.

This can come from the kind of brilliant innovations devised by Thomas Edison (pictured) or the less-heralded but equally important improvements such as the adoption of the moving conveyor belt to speed up assembly work. Since there are limits to the amount of additional capital and labour, productivity is key to long-run growth.Measuring productivity is far from easy; it tends to be the residual left over when all other factors have been accounted for.

Rigid sell-by dates and a squeamish attitude to imperfection encourage us to throw away perfectly good food: tops are cut off turnips, beetroot and carrots before we have even had a chance to think of using them; ingredients prepared in advance in restaurants are destined for the bin on a quiet night; butternut squash cores and seeds are thrown out when making spiralised vegetable noodles; and imperfect melon trimmings are abandoned to make our little pots of pre-chopped fruit more presentable ... And that’s without even a mention of the fuel and water that has been used to produce and transport it all. A third of the food we produce worldwide goes to waste, enough to feed 17 million people. There is so much work to be done and I am sure I don’t even know the half of it.Recently, this talk of waste has spread to our top dining rooms. Only this week, one of my favourite British cooks, Skye Gyngell, launched her scratch menu at her restaurant, Spring (see p12).

I’m all for eating vegetables, and certainly wouldn’t wish bad weather on any producer, but there isn’t any need to eat courgettes just now. If we want green things at this time of year, we should be eating dark winter greens such as kale, cavolo nero and sprouting broccoli, not courgettes, which aren’t designed to battle their way through frosts and rain.Now is also the best time to eat veg that has been hiding away under the surface over winter, protecting itself from the elements as nature intended it to. Celeriac is my current favourite, not least because it’s so versatile: grated raw in a salad, as you would beetroot or carrot; mashed as an alternative to potato; roasted whole or in a gratin; blitzed in a soup… I could go on. I’m told celeriac also works very well when spiralised and lightly steamed, but I’m not sure I’ll be going there. Continue reading..."},

Once I got it, I would have a week off school so they could whip out my tonsils, then, like a boy in my class, I too would be prescribed ice-cream and jelly for breakfast. Despite getting on my knees and repeating hail Marys, I got neither tonsillitis, nor the soothing rewards. Unless your tonsils are being removed, ice-cream is not an appropriate way to start the day, I might well have been told. But try telling this to a Sicilian – my partner for example – who, from spring to late autumn, thinks gelato and granita a perfectly ordinary and sensible way to begin the day.The first time I saw my childhood fantasy alive and kicking was in Catania, a lively city on the east coast in the shadow of Mount Etna. In the fish market, which plays out like a piece of bloody theatre in the sunken Piazza Duomo, men were standing around a market bar eating sweet, yeasted brioche – split and filled, generously, with ice-cream. In the smallest of the bars opposite the duomo itself, people of all sorts were starting their day with glass cups of almond, coffee or lemon granita, spoonfuls alternated with bites of warm brioche.

There are restaurants that try to hoodwink you, angry chefs to contend with and, as the Observer’s Jay Rayner found out recently, always the possibility that a place you have raved about may have kitchens that are not entirely rodent-free.

In this city, there’s something for every occasion: the brunch place good for breaking up with someone in the park afterward; the by-the-slice place with a killer eggplant and fresh ricotta; the pasta place, when all you want is an old-school joint started by a former longshoreman, because you were wandering the Navy Yard pretending you were in On the Waterfront. (You know, hypothetically.) The flip side is that those restaurants are definitively not perfect for other occasions. But Olmsted, if you can get a reservation (and that is a big if—last I checked, it was booked solid through mid-February), is suitable for just about any night. The price at the new Prospect Heights restaurant is right (everything is under twenty-five dollars). The garden is enchanted (a friend I took there was convinced I was about to propose). It’s not too noisy; not too precious; not too far; not too healthy; not too gluttonous. I still dream of the frozen yogurt topped with warm, whipped lavender honey, and I want to go back to try their hot chocolate out in the back yard, wrapped in Pendleton blankets. I know it sounds impossibly twee, but in their hands I trust that it works."},

In this extract from his new book, Matt Goulding heads for Valencia in search of the perfect dishIf you look closely enough, you will find the entire history of Spain within the perimeter of a paella pan. Olive oil, the golden film that forms the base of every paella, adding depth and a gentle sheen to the bed of grains, is the story of a hungry ancient Rome expanding its empire across Iberia, one olive tree at a time. Tomato, the heart of the sofrito that lends colour and a savoury-sweet baseline to a proper paella, is the story of Spain’s own vision of empire and conquest, and the unexpected treasures it pillaged from the New World. And the heart of paella – the rice, saffron and vegetables that fill out the pan – speaks of 700 years of Moorish rule leaving a footprint on the Iberian peninsula; one that informs how Spain eats, drinks and lives to this day.

Guardian restaurant critic Marina O’Loughlin eats her way round the diners and restaurants fusing cuisines and creating fresh twists on American classicsAmong America’s great cities, the name of Phoenix, Arizona, does not loom large. Yoghurt, the old joke goes, has more culture than Phoenix. This is a city where even the poshest eating establishments have TVs behind the bar tuned to the sports channel. Nobody seems to actually come from here – the rapidly expanding city is populated largely by incomers, attracted by low taxes, attractive property prices, desert heat and killer sunsets.So what the hell am I doing here, among the gun-totin’ and Trump-votin’? It’s because there has been a concerted effort to regenerate, revivify, reinvent. With museums and galleries a-plenty, that culture sneer is no longer valid; plus there’s a wealth of mid-century modernism and an expanding light rail system to whisk you around.

Share your stories anonymouslyThings that are glorified in the hospitality industry: sleep-deprivation, tempers, drugs, projectiles in kitchens (especially sharp ones), hedonism, asceticism, camaraderie, martial law, all broadly clustered under the umbrella idea that perfectionism makes you inherently unstable, and that’s a good thing. Chefs are admired for being gits. Street angel, kitchen devil is used as a badge of honour, rather than identified for what it is, a description of a person who bullies where they can and sucks up everywhere else.Random acts of violence are seen as proof that the person who got scalded by a hot knife has an authentic passion for the job, rather than that the person who scalded them has poor impulse control. Indeed, in a top-end kitchen, an environment of such precision that one is expected to care about the dimensions of a carrot at the level of the millimetre, the single area in which no control is expected is that of one’s own behaviour; but only if you’re in charge.

What cuts of beef are best? Can bacon replace salt pork? And how pricey a wine do you need to use?It’s a mystery to me how this giant of the French classical repertoire has escaped the clutches of this column for so long. Richard Olney (another big beast of the Gallic cookery scene) describes boeuf bourguignon as probably the most widely known of all French preparations, while Elizabeth David introduces it as a favourite among those carefully composed, slowly cooked dishes, which are the domain of French housewives and owner-cooks of modest restaurants rather than of professional chefs.Sounds manageable. Yet Olney goes on, slightly worryingly, that beef burgundy certainly deserves its reputation – or would if the few details essential to its success were more often respected. There is nothing difficult about its preparation, but there are no shortcuts. And David doesn’t help the situation, with the airy assertion that such dishes do not, of course, have a rigid formula, each cook interpreting it according to her taste. Continue reading..."},

Here are five bottles your liquor cabinet cant do without These ingredients aren’t usually seen at home – but their presence opens up a realm of cocktail possibilitiesEvery working bartender will be familiar with this scenario: you go to visit friends or family on one of your nights off, and someone suggests that you whip up a round of mixed drinks for everyone. What can you make with this? they ask, gesturing to a liquor cabinet that contains a bottle of gin, a bottle of white rum, a bottle of vodka, a bottle of tequila, and maybe a bottle of Baileys. Your heart sinks – the answer is, well, Not much.Professional cocktail bartenders don’t just work with the well-known base spirits that you can find in any liquor store. They also work with a host of more recondite ingredients known in industry lingo as modifiers, which enable the alchemical transformation of the base metals of those popular spirits into the gold of a balanced cocktail. Some of these ingredients are poured liberally, while others are applied only in judicious little splashes and dashes – but asking someone to make a cocktail without them is like asking a chef to turn a raw steak into a meal with only a frypan.

Try using something old and something newWhen the markets have been selling the same produce for months, one way to keep mealtimes exciting is to seek inspiration from your kitchen cupboards. No matter how bare they may seem, there is often something hidden away at the back that will add va-va-voom to your cooking. Take today’s pie: use that old packet of dried mushrooms to turn a simple dish into something memorable. Guinea fowl may sound extravagant, but it is very tasty and no more expensive than a decent chicken; if you prefer, use leftover chicken: you’ll still get a terrific pie. And while you’re digging deep in those cupboards, pull out those bags of nuts, spices and dried fruit and use them to make a wobbly, feather-light yoghurt cake. Continue reading..."},
  {"topic": "Food", "subtopic": "General", "text": "From Instagram to TV ads, what’s the science behind food porn? What does the bombardment of food imagery do to our brains and bodies? The ‘gastrophysicist’ who has worked with Heston Blumenthal explains all in an extract from his new bookYour brain is your body’s most blood-thirsty organ, using around 25% of total blood flow (or energy) – despite the fact that it accounts for only 2% of body mass. Given that our brains have evolved to find food, it should perhaps come as little surprise to discover that some of the largest increases in cerebral blood flow occur when a hungry brain is exposed to images of desirable foods. Adding delicious food aromas makes this effect even more pronounced. Within little more than the blink of an eye, our brains make a judgment call about how much we like the foods we see and how nutritious they might be. And so you might be starting to get the idea behind gastroporn.No doubt we have all heard our stomachs rumbling when we contemplate a tasty meal. Viewing food porn can induce salivation, not to mention the release of digestive juices as the gut prepares for what is about to come. Simply reading about delicious food can have much the same effect. In terms of the brain’s response to images of palatable or highly desirable foods (food porn, in other words), research shows widespread activation of a host of brain areas, including the taste and reward areas. The magnitude of this increase in neural activity, not to mention the enhanced connectivity between brain areas, typically depends on how hungry the viewer is, whether they are dieting (ie, whether they are a restrained eater or not) and whether they are obese. (The latter, for instance, tend to show a more pronounced brain response to food images even when full.) Continue reading..."},

Miyamoto conceived Hyrule, the setting for Nintendo’s Legend of Zelda series, in 1986, and though its layout has changed often in the intervening decades, its ambiance of bucolic, occasionally threatening whimsy hasn’t. Neither has the company’s understanding of Zelda’s essential purpose: to bring the great outdoors—the rollicking hills, the whispering caves, all that breezy, alfresco escapade—indoors. In recent years, Miyamoto, who is now sixty-four, has retreated to the position of Zelda’s overseer, relinquishing control to younger directors inside the clandestine, Willy Wonka-esque factory that is Nintendo’s Kyoto headquarters. (In 2010, Nick Paumgarten made it farther than most—to a conference room just inside the gates.) But Hyrule remains indelibly his. Indeed, it is based on Miyamoto’s boyhood experiences roaming the countryside around Sonobe, Japan."},

Her Armenian father had made a fortune in the Lancashire cotton trade and left most of it to Sybil.

Lovecraft’s stories about monstrous beings from beyond the stars were appearing regularly in the pulp magazine Weird Tales, and Barlow was a fan. He wanted to know when Lovecraft had started writing, what he was working on now, and whether the Necronomicon—a tome of forbidden knowledge that appears in several Lovecraft tales—was a real book. A week later, Lovecraft wrote back, as he nearly always did. It’s estimated that he wrote more than fifty thousand letters in his relatively short lifetime (he died at the age of forty-six). This particular letter was the beginning of a curious friendship, which changed the course of Barlow’s life, and Lovecraft’s, too—though almost no one who reads Lovecraft these days knows anything about it.

Nothing quite like it, other than pipelines and aqueducts of similar length, had been seen in recorded history. It was built by soldiers. Working their way from east to west, they mostly finished in four years, with additions over the next two. But, once built, the wall was fully manned by its makers for as little as a decade. Afterward, it cycled through abandonment and reoccupation—a landmark whose significance shifted continually over the three centuries of slow turmoil that followed, until the successors to its builders eventually withdrew altogether from that land. The wall’s original purpose is subject to debate. Military historians suggest that the wall wasn’t especially well-calibrated—to either the contours of its place or the tactics of its time—as a fortification. Its relentless regularity suggested something conceived and imposed from afar. Its nominal builder was known as a patron and connoisseur of architecture. Some theorize that, thanks to a pale plastered surface, the wall would have shone brilliantly in the sun—and that this display was its purpose as much as any other."},

IF THERE is a consensus right now in American politics, it must be that infrastructure spending is a good thing. It employs workers, improves economic efficiency and, at the moment, can be financed at rock-bottom bond yields. So why don’t governments get on with it?The problem is multi-faceted. Although people tend to be enthusiastic about infrastructure in general, they are more critical of specific projects. If they are in the country, then they ruin the currency; if they are in the town, then they ruin neighbourhoods or impinge on private-property rights. When it comes to public infrastructure projects, the benefits are long term but the costs are short term. The politician that authorises the project is rarely the same one that opens it. So an elected leader gets all the flak from those who oppose this white elephant/blot on the landscape but none of the praise for the reduced traffic jams or cheaper power that ensue.

In 2014, a post began making the rounds on Facebook, urging people to fill their timelines with links to music, to break the monotony of selfies and sensationalism. By late 2015, the form of the monotony had changed; now it consisted of nasty, divisive headlines and negativity. Soon it had become the monotony of politics and posts about people killing each other. This most recent revival of the meme bore witness to the early summer of 2016, with its seemingly endless litany of bad news—Baghdad’s worst bombing in more than a decade, the Orlando night-club massacre, the Istanbul airport explosion, continued police shootings in the United States, flares of terrorism and far-right nativism across Europe, and a farcically ugly U.S. Presidential election, all set to the relentless bass line of climate-change reports, which counted out one record-breakingly hot month after another."},

Now a team of researchers has a controversial plan to root out the perpetratorsOne morning last summer, a German psychologist named Mathias Kauff woke up to find that he had been reprimanded by a robot. In an email, a computer program named Statcheck informed him that a 2013 paper he had published on multiculturalism and prejudice appeared to contain a number of incorrect calculations – which the program had catalogued and then posted on the internet for anyone to see. The problems turned out to be minor – just a few rounding errors – but the experience left Kauff feeling rattled. At first I was a bit frightened, he said. I felt a bit exposed.Kauff wasn’t alone. Statcheck had read some 50,000 published psychology papers and checked the maths behind every statistical result it encountered. In the space of 24 hours, virtually every academic active in the field in the past two decades had received an email from the program, informing them that their work had been reviewed. Nothing like this had ever been seen before: a massive, open, retroactive evaluation of scientific literature, conducted entirely by computer. Continue reading..."},

In the course of it, Snowden – who was of course Skyping in from Moscow – said that without Ellsberg’s example he would not have done what he did to expose the extent to which the NSA was spying on millions of ordinary people. It was an extraordinary declaration. It meant that the consequences of Ellsberg’s release of the top-secret Pentagon Papers in 1971 were not limited to the impact on a presidency and a war in the 1970s. The consequences were not limited to people alive at that moment. His act was to have an impact on people decades later – Snowden was born 12 years after Ellsberg risked his future for the sake of his principles. Actions often ripple far beyond their immediate objective, and remembering this is reason to live by principle and act in hope that what you do matters, even when results are unlikely to be immediate or obvious.The most important effects are often the most indirect.

Steve King, a Republican congressman from Iowa, could hardly have been clearer in his meaning in a tweet this week supporting Geert Wilders, a Dutch politician with anti-immigrant views. Across the rich world, those of a similar mind have been emboldened by a nativist turn in politics. Some do push back: plenty of Americans rallied against Donald Trump’s plans to block refugees and migrants. Yet few rich-world politicians are willing to make the case for immigration that it deserves: it is a good thing and there should be much more of it.Defenders of immigration often fight on nativist turf, citing data to respond to claims about migrants’ damaging effects on wages or public services. Those data are indeed on migrants’ side. Though some research suggests that native workers with skill levels similar to those of arriving migrants take a hit to their wages because of increased migration, most analyses find that they are not harmed, and that many eventually earn more as competition nudges them to specialise in more demanding occupations.

A better question to ask might be who isn’t touched by it, here or abroad. An earlier version of the order, which Trump signed on January 27th and judges on the Ninth Circuit blocked two weeks later, banned people from seven Muslim-majority nations and all refugees. This one drops Iraq from the list. It also makes less of a point of Syrian refugees being people whom the United States particularly does not want. And it offers exemptions to several groups, most notably people who have green cards or had visas as of January 27th. The goal, in other words, is to carve out exceptions, at least for the moment, for people who have the most obvious routes to challenge the order in court and for some whose plight is particularly conspicuous, such as translators who worked for the U.S. in Iraq, to whom many in the military (and beyond) feel a debt of honor. It’s the just-don’t-touch-me-or-mine version of the order, which means that the question of whether it constitutes a religious test—a constitutional violation that would, as a matter of law, harm every American—is joined by another: How much power does President Trump have to divide people, and how willing are Americans to play along?"},

While Porter didn’t fully endorse Scheidel’s thesis that violence, in history, is the only real cure to income inequality, he did leave his readers without much hope for narrowing America’s current income distributions by less destructive means. Coming out of the November election, we can see his point. For an election marked by resentment of the rich from seemingly all corners—of Wall Street fat cats, by Bernie Sanders supporters; of the global élite, by Donald Trump supporters; of Trump himself, by Hillary Clinton supporters—it’s hard to name a policy offered by any of those candidates that would really reduce income inequality. Higher taxes and lower out-of-pocket college costs would level disposable income, but it wouldn’t change why a hedge-fund manager makes billions while a schoolteacher makes thousands.

The daughter of a Methodist minister, she was born in 1945 in Abilene, Texas. Having graduated with a degree in English from McMurry University, she enrolled at the University of Texas Law School in 1964, one of 40 women among a student body of 1,600. I thought I would be teaching eighth graders to love Beowulf, she recalls. But that wasn’t working out so well, so I decided to go to law school instead. In this, I was encouraged by the dean of my college, who told me that it would be far too tough for a woman. ‘As sure as dammit I am going,’ I thought.After graduating, she joined a group of students who were seeking to challenge anti-abortion laws, agreeing to file a suit against the state of Texas on their behalf. Soon after, 21-year-old Norma McCorvey was referred to Weddington and her colleague Linda Coffee, now actively looking for pregnant women who were seeking abortions. McCorvey became the plaintiff Jane Roe, though by the time the supreme court issued its ruling, her baby had long since been born and given up for adoption. McCorvey later became an evangelical Christian and vocal anti-abortion campaigner, and claimed to have been the victim of the Roe v Wade lawyers. She died last month aged 69. Continue reading..."},

The Court was supposed to review the case of Gavin Grimm, a transgender teen-age boy who sued the Gloucester County School Board for the right to use the boys’ bathroom and won, in the Fourth Circuit. But the basis of the Fourth Circuit’s decision was the Obama Administration’s view that Title IX, the 1972 law that prohibits schools that receive federal funding from discriminating on the basis of sex, requires schools to treat transgender students in a way consistent with their gender identity. Last month, the Trump Administration retracted that position. Both Grimm and the school board urged the Supreme Court to review the case as planned, arguing that the government’s shift made it no less urgent for the Court to declare Title IX’s meaning. But the Supreme Court decided to vacate the lower court’s decision and send the case back for reconsideration.

But now that there’s a new administration in the US that has made dismantling reproductive rights a first-week-in-office priority, is TV finally ready to talk abortion? Shows such as Scandal, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and Girls have already featured major storylines in which unhappily up-the-duff women explore all their options, but this spring a new 10-part series promises to be TV’s most prescient depiction of women’s reproductive rights to date. Like the Margaret Atwood novel on which it’s based, The Handmaid’s Tale is set in the Republic of Gilead, a near-future, totalitarian theocracy in what used to be the US, where abortion is outlawed as part of the repressive regime. Elisabeth Moss stars as the titular handmaid, one of a class of women whose purpose in society is purely reproductive. Showing on Hulu in the US, it includes updated references to Tinder, Isis and campus sexual assault, but much of the substance remains unchanged from the 1985 novel, including a scene where Offred (Moss) and her fellow handmaid, Ofglen (Alexis Bledel) walk past a wall where executed prisoners are hung as a deterrent to subversive behaviour.

In the ensuing hail of criticism Carson doubled down, saying that it was possible for someone to be an involuntary immigrant. The defenses of Carson centered upon strict adherence to the definition of the word immigrant as a person who leaves one country to take up residence in another. This is roughly akin to arguing that it is technically possible to refer to a kidnapping victim as a house guest, presuming the latter term refers to a temporary visitor to one’s home.

The hearing had been moved to Bayonne High School, to accommodate a large crowd, and wound up lasting six hours. When a group of Muslims stood to pray as the meeting convened, a group of Christians stood in response and recited the Lord’s Prayer, according to the Times. At the microphone, one opponent of the proposed mosque asked the board to press its organizers on what they believed. Another read violent passages out of the Koran. One woman asked, How many people have died because of this so-called religion? There was testimony from Coptic Christians whose relatives had been murdered by Muslims in Egypt, and who wanted that violence kept away from Bayonne. The mosque’s supporters needed five votes, but they got only four. The Muslim Brotherhood was brought up in this meeting, for chrissakes, someone said early on. The great New Jersey political reporter Matt Katz, now of WNYC, pointed out that this countering of the grandiose with the profane was the Jersey-est thing said so far."},

The young couple had recently returned to New York after several years abroad. In Europe, they had read the signs. Jews were fleeing Germany; in Italy, Mussolini was an object of worship. Back in the United States, which they had left in 1929, they were startled by the changes wrought by the Depression. At stoplights, grown men, respectable men—our fathers—stepped forward to ask for a nickel, rag in hand to wipe our windshield, Mary recalls in her memoir, Meaning a Life, which was published in 1978. Though they had always been leftists, Mary and George now wanted to find an organization with which they could ally themselves. They spoke with the son of the founder of the Socialist Labor Party. They listened to Trotskyites. And then, at the Seventh World Congress of the Communist International, the Communist Party proclaimed a Popular Front against Fascism. This, for George and Mary, was a turning point. We said to each other, ‘Let’s work with the unemployed and leave our interest in the arts for a later time,’  Mary writes."},

She was about twenty, enslaved since her birth at Mount Vernon—a light mulatto girl, much freckled, with very black eyes and bushy hair, according to a runaway advertisement in a local paper, of middle stature, slender, and delicately formed. Her father was a white indentured tailor, her mother a black seamstress, one of the nearly three hundred slaves Martha Washington had inherited after the death of her first husband. There had been no suspicion of her going off, nor no provocation to do so, the ad stated, with an aggrieved note; Judge had been Martha’s personal servant, and was a particular favorite of hers. But the Washingtons knew that slaves could claim their freedom after six months on Pennsylvania soil, and had been careful to deny theirs the chance by regularly taking them out of state. Judge had made her escape just before they planned to travel home to Virginia. She was found in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where the customs collector interviewed her at Washington’s behest. A thirst for compleat freedom, he reported, had been her only motive for absconding."},

Aaron Hicklin meets Misty Copeland, the first black principal at the American Ballet TheatreWe cannot know whether Misty Copeland would have become America’s most celebrated ballet dancer if she had not met Cindy Bradley, the flame-haired instructor who first recognised and then sharpened her talents, but it seems unlikely. Then again, it’s doubtful that Copeland would have met Bradley if not for Elizabeth Cantine, the coach of her school drill team who urged her to check out the free ballet class at the Boys & Girls Club of San Pedro. Nor is it clear that Copeland would have joined Cantine’s squad without the encouragement of her adored older sister, Erica, a drill team star. It was Erica who helped Copeland choreograph an audition piece to George Michael’s I Want Your Sex. And who, knowing her story, can omit the Russian gymnast Nadia Comaneci from this roll call? As a seven-year-old, trying to emulate Comaneci’s pyrotechnics, Copeland instinctively understood that rhythmic motion came as naturally to me as breathing, to quote from her memoir, Life in Motion.This is life, a cascading series of chance encounters and arbitrary choices that shape our destinies, but for a young black girl in a working-class Los Angeles suburb, who characterises her childhood as packing, scrambling, leaving – often barely surviving, catching the right breaks are nigh on impossible. Yet through whatever alchemy of grit, resilience and compulsion, Misty Copeland, a 65lb ragamuffin when she arrived at Bradley’s class, beat the odds. In August 2015 she was promoted to principal dancer for the American Ballet Theatre (ABT), the first black woman to achieve the distinction in the theatre’s 75-year history. Continue reading..."},

But it isn’t the answer – and it won’t workI’m a shark biologist and I also love to surf. One of my favourite surfing memories isn’t one of my rides, however, but of being a spectator. I remember standing on the Waimea shoreline in 2009, feeling the beach shake as enormous waves thundered to a close. Moments before, my favourite surfer had just scored a 98 point ride in the prestigious Eddie competition, named in honour of Hawaiian surfing legend Eddie Aikau. That surfer was Kelly Slater.Slater’s name is currently synonymous with sharks because of comments he made following the tragic death of body boarder Alexandre Naussac on 21 February 2017 in the waters of Reunion Island. Naussac was killed by a bite by a bull shark, and in the shock that followed, Slater spoke out, backing the long-held views of Reunion Island local and pro surfer Jeremy Flores, and called for a cull on the sharks around Reunion. This quickly led to a barrage of online attacks and misinformation from people on both sides of the argument. Continue reading..."},

For an occupying force, the dam, twenty-five miles north of Mosul, was an appealing target: it regulates the flow of water to the city, and to millions of Iraqis who live along the Tigris. As the ISIS invaders approached, they could make out the dam’s four towers, standing over a wide, squat structure that looks like a brutalist mausoleum.

So what is the best treatment – and how can you keep bones strong?Margaret Hawkyard knew something was wrong when she drove over a speed bump and felt her back seize up, suddenly and painfully. A few months later, she reached up to open a garage door and felt the same unpleasant jolt. Soon after, it got so bad that she couldn’t get into bed without help. My GP kept saying it was muscular and giving me painkillers. I’m not soft, but I was so desperate that I paid to see a specialist By then, I couldn’t get on the couch to be examined and he had to give me morphine to get home. Hawkyard had been treated for breast cancer in the past. After seeing the scan, the doctor said that the good news was that the cancer hadn’t come back, but the bad news was that I had five or six vertebral fractures. It took three months of physiotherapy before she started to recover.But it took me much longer to get my confidence back and get over my fear that it could happen again.Hawkyard’s back had broken because of osteoporosis, a condition that makes bones weak and fragile. It rarely causes symptoms until a minor fall or sudden impact makes a bone break. The wrist, hips and vertebrae are the most vulnerable because they take most of the impact, but any bone can break if it is weak – even a violent sneeze can fracture an osteoporotic rib or vertebra. Professor Justin Cobb, chair of orthopaedics at Imperial College London, says: Osteoporotic bone is like a honeycomb that is gradually becoming more fragile and can be squashed by too great a force; it’s fine while it’s sitting on the shelf, but if you drop it, it’s going to break.

The suburb is home to many families from the Pacific Islands and was once the home to another son of industrious Tongan parents, the late great Jonah Lomu. In Maori culture there is a concept called mana that pervades Māngere, whether in church, school or at home. It denotes personal and collective pride, strength and identity. No man or woman is bigger than their community in a Tongan family. When you rise, you support your relatives along the way, as they have helped you in your development.Two years ago, Piutau was an All Black who made a decision that some of his compatriots struggled to understand. At the age of 23 he was recognised regularly on the streets on Auckland as a rising star for his provincial and international teams. To the surprise of rugby fans in New Zealand, Piutau decided to postpone his international career and sign for Ulster. An All Black must play their club rugby in New Zealand and Piutau was swapping the fabled black jersey for the white of Ulster. Continue reading..."},

Progression, in any other sport, is made up of increments that have long been laid down: footballers, netballers and cricketers join junior clubs and rise through levels defined by age until they reach open, or adult, competition. Surfing differs in that the vast majority of people who take part in it don’t compete. There are clubs but, again, they’re contest-oriented and that’s not where the bulk of the interest lies.

Today, barely half of entrants can make that claim: 15 of the 32 teams in this year’s group stage failed to win their domestic leagues in 2015-16.

Starting in 2018-19, half of the 32 group-stage places will be reserved for the top four teams in the four best-performing leagues in European competitions (Spain, Germany, England and Italy).

Gary Neville had been especially calamitous, furiously sweeping at the sweat-sodden curtains on his forehead having teed up one of Brazil’s greatest goalscorers, Romario, twice.Vasco da Gama were cruising to half-time when they delivered the goal that encapsulated the European champions’ humiliating jaunt to Brazil.

Like many Americans, Haddock, a practicing attorney in his late 40s, was hit hard by the 2008 recession – so hard it curdled the way he saw the world. People had become so obsessed with accumulating stuff, Haddock came to believe, that they had lost touch with what was important. This pervasive materialism, he thought, was a way of thinking that was inevitably doomed.Desperate to reconnect with something meaningful, Haddock found himself turning to unexpected places. Though he was raised Southern Baptist, he now regularly sought refuge in the Book of the Hopi – a compendium of teachings drawn from 30 Hopi elders in northern Arizona. He researched paganism in Ireland, and spent nine months visiting the Kabbalah Centre in Dallas (he left because the staff kept trying to sell him things). Once, in Tennessee, he visited a man who’d built his house over a Native American burial ground: The basement wall had fallen in, and I went and put my head against it.

Her parents, observant Muslims, were as accepting of her head scarf as they had been of her uncovered head. To be religious in Tunisia, after all, was as mainstream as speaking French—and it was often during their teens that girls decided it was time to put on the hijab. But when Ajengui showed up at school, the principal said that she couldn’t attend while covered. Surely, she thought, the country’s new President, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, who had taken power in 1987, must have been unaware of this injustice: even though the government had historically suppressed religion, Ben Ali had promised more freedoms.

On January 8th, having been promised generous bonuses, the soldiers returned to their barracks. Alassane Ouattara, the president, sacked the army and police chiefs.

The Xisha, or Western Sands, are islands in the South China Sea that are known in English as the Paracels. The textbook described the islands, which are located in waters between China and Vietnam, as cute, with multicolored coral and plentiful turtles that could be hunted for their valuable shells. The lesson, however, neglected to mention that ownership of the Paracels, like that of many islands in the South China Sea, is in dispute. In 1974, China seized complete control of the Paracel island chain from an overextended South Vietnam. Since then, the Chinese have managed to effectively take control of other shoals and maritime features that are claimed by other countries, like the Philippines. In the past couple of years, Chinese dredgers have transformed contested rocks and reefs into military bases, complete with structures that can house surface-to-air-missile batteries.

Even before he came to national notice, after fresh reports of negligence, and 12% mortality, at his private zoo, South Lakes, his autobiography suggests his charges have long been unusually prone to escaping and/or dying. It is more than 10 years, for instance, since Australian authorities fined him $10,000 in absentia – he having fled the country – for breaches of permit conditions at his Queensland zoo, including the unreported death of a lemur and a cheetah on the loose. Five witnesses, said one newspaper report, described the situation as one of panic and stated Gill was chasing the animal on a motorbike.The blurb for his self-published, Nine Lives: One Man’s Insatiable Journey Through Love, Life and Near Death, only hints at the suffering this has caused Gill. He risked his own life attempting to save a drowning kangaroo and again when he walked into a raging inferno to save his own lemurs. Tragedy struck when he had to shoot his own rhino in a mercy killing. In fact, it was the misfortune of the escaped white rhino, Zimba, to have been inadequately enclosed, for which Gill was fined £10,000. Continue reading..."},

The rights include that a death sentence may be imposed only for the most serious crimes, defined as intentional crimes that have lethal or other extremely grave consequences, and that execution be carried out only after a final judgment rendered by a competent court, following a legal process that insures a fair trial and that provides access to appeal to a higher court and the opportunity to seek a pardon or a commutation of the sentence."},

Coming just three weeks before he is due to step down, it was an admission by America’s senior diplomat that he, like so many before him, had failed to make any noticeable contribution to ending this stubborn struggle.The speech was essentially an analysis of the policies of the current Israeli government which Mr Kerry described the most right-wing in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by the most extreme elements. He questioned its desire for peace with the Palestinians, given the relentless expansion of Jewish settlements in lands conquered by Israel in 1967. Does it really want an intensifying conflict in the West Bank? asked Mr Kerry. How does that help Israel’s security? How does that help the region?Donald Trump, the president-elect, and many of Israel’s supporters in America and beyond criticised him.

But away from the headlines a parallel catastrophe has been unfolding in the country’s juvenile detention centres, with campaigners demanding reforms and warning that proposals to stiffen sentences for young offenders could compound the crisis in the penal system.Under existing law, offenders aged 12 to 18 are supposed to be dealt with through community service or education, with a maximum penalty of up to three years at a detention centre for the most serious crimes.
